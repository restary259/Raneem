      {
        "question": "How are students tracked?",
        "answer": "Each partner gets a unique tracking link and shared spreadsheet. When a student registers through your link, they are automatically linked to your name. You can track each student's status with full transparency."
      },
      {
        "question": "When are commissions paid?",
        "answer": "Commissions are paid 20 days after the student's payment date. The 20-day period is necessary to protect both parties from cancellations or refunds."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why the 20-day period?",
        "answer": "This period protects both the partner and the company. If a student changes their mind or requests a refund during this period, the partner is not affected. After the period ends, the commission is transferred directly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What data can I see?",
        "answer": "You can see: names of students registered through your link, each student's status (qualified, unqualified, contacted, in progress, paid, transferred), and registration date."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you ensure transparency?",
        "answer": "We provide a read-only shared spreadsheet that is continuously updated. At the end of each month, the spreadsheet is closed and a new one is opened. All previous data remains visible."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there costs to join?",
        "answer": "There are no costs at all. Joining is completely free and we provide you with all the support to get started."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I choose my own content style?",
        "answer": "Yes, you have complete freedom to choose your style, platform, and promotion method. We provide you with the information and materials, and you choose how to present them to your audience."
