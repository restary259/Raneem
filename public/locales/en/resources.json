In most cases, you'll need to complete a preparatory year (Studienkolleg) before starting university.\n\nThe first step is applying through uni-assist — the central institution that evaluates your credentials and determines if you qualify for direct admission or need to go through the preparatory program.\n\nIdeal Timeline:\n• 12 months before: Start learning German (aim for B1 minimum)\n• 8 months before: Prepare documents — Bagrut transcript, certified translations, passport\n• 6 months before: Apply through uni-assist (fees around €75)\n• 4 months before: Receive admission and begin visa procedures\n\nDarb's tip: Don't wait for your final Bagrut results to start preparing. Begin language learning and document collection as early as possible. Many of our students lost an entire semester because they started late."

Appointments fill up fast, so try booking at least 3 months ahead.\n\nBlocked Account (Sperrkonto):\nMost popular banks: Expatrio or Fintiba. The process is online and takes 3-5 business days. Transfer the amount and receive confirmation for the embassy.\n\nDarb's tip: Prepare a complete, organized file. The embassy can reject your application if documents are missing.

Open a Bank Account: We recommend N26 (online and fast) or Sparkasse (branches everywhere). You'll need your passport and Anmeldung confirmation.\n\n3. Phone SIM Card: Aldi Talk or Lidl Connect — cheapest options that work well. Activation requires a video call with your passport.\n\n4. Transport: Deutschlandticket for €49/month — gets you everywhere by train and bus.\n\n5. Health Insurance: Register immediately. Without insurance, you can't enroll at university.\n\nCulture Shock? It's Normal:\n- Germans value punctuality — arriving 5 minutes late can be an issue\n- Shops are closed on Sundays — shop beforehand!\n- People may seem cold at first but it's their style, not disrespect\n\nDarb's tip: Join our WhatsApp group for new students — you'll find instant help from students who've been through it all."
